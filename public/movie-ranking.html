 <h2>These three movies are really special to me.</h2>

 <h3>The Lion King</h3>

 <p>This movie is my favorite disney animated movie. I can recite this movie line by line.</p>

 <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
 <p>This was the first anime movie that I watched when Toonami was airing on television.</p>

 <h3>The Ring</h3>
 <p>It was the first PG-13 horror movie that I was allowed to watch. My dad and I watched it together.</p>
